## About the project
Further building on my exisitng front-end skills, this portfolio uses React as a framework to create a mobile-firt, responsive portfolio demonstating my skills and expierence. The site includes a brief profile of myself, along with a number of examples of previous work including the most recent group project. It also highlights some of the key skills I've learnt during the course of the University of Birmingham's coding camp and includes an up-to-date CV.

It uses Material Design as its CSS framework and HashRouter to display with Github pages.

### Built using
* React
* aos animation

----------

## Functionality  
![React Portfolio](https://github.com/HannahSones/reactPortfolio/blob/main/public/assets/appWalkthrough.gif)   

The homepage displays key information such a my CV, bio and skillsey. Using routing you can click through to other 'pages' including a contact page and portfolio page. Components load onto the page using AOS for animation for improved user experience.

-------------

## Installation
1. Clone the code from the GitHub repo
2. Open project directory, then install all required dependencies by using npm install
3. Enter `yarn start` to run the application in development mode in your localhost
4. The page will reload automatically if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

------------------
## Deployed link   
Or you can view the live deployment of the application on [Github Pages](https://hannahsones.github.io/reactPortfolio/).

-------------
## Further Development
When I have more time, I would like to improve the app by:
* Improve the user interface of the portfolio page so that you can filter projects by technology used i.e. React, MongoDB etc.
* Wiring up the contact form so that emails can be sent directly to my personal email address
